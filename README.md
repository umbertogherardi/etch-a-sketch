## About 

A simple frontend application that brings together foundational JavaScript, HTML, and CSS concepts. Developed as one of the final projects for The Odin Project's [*Foundations Course*](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) in my spare time. More info on this particular project can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).
